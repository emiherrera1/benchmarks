# Logo Setup Instructions

## To add the CVA Accelerator logo:

1. Save your logo image as `cva-logo.png`
2. Place it in this directory: `assets/images/cva-logo.png`
3. The logo should be:
   - PNG format with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200x40 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
   - White logo on transparent background works best

## Current Setup:
- Both projects are configured to use `assets/images/cva-logo.png`
- The logo will be displayed at 40px height
- It's clickable and links to https://cvaccelerator.com
- Fixed header positioning for consistent branding

## Alternative:
If you prefer to host the logo elsewhere, update the image source in:
- `index.html` (line with `<img src="assets/images/cva-logo.png"`)
- Change to your preferred URL
